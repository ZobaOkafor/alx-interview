    Determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

    Parameters:
    coins (list of int): A list of the values of the coins in your possession.
    total (int): The target amount to reach using the fewest number of coins.

    Returns:
    int: The fewest number of coins needed to meet the total.
         Returns 0 if the total is 0 or less.
         Returns -1 if the total cannot be met by any combination of coins.

    Example:
    >>> makeChange([1, 2, 25], 37)
    7
    >>> makeChange([1256, 54, 48, 16, 102], 1453)
