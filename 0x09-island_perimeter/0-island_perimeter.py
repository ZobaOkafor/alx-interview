"""
Module that calculates the perimeter of an island represented in a grid.
The grid is a list of list of integers where 0 represents water and 1
represents land. Each cell in the grid is a square with a side length of 1,
and the cells are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
The grid is rectangular and completely surrounded by water.
